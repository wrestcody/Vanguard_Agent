# Vanguard_Agent

## Threat-Informed GRC for Mission Assurance

**Vanguard_Agent** is a modular, automated GRC agent designed to transform raw compliance data into actionable, threat-informed intelligence. By integrating policy-as-code (OPA/Rego) and AI-driven analysis, this agent enriches continuous compliance evidence (CCE) to prioritize risks based on organizational policy and real-world threats, not just default severity scores.

This project is a core component of a larger GRC engineering ecosystem, demonstrating a commitment to:
- **Systems Thinking:** Designing modular, interconnected components for a holistic GRC solution.
- **GRC-as-Code:** Automating GRC processes to improve efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
- **AI-Powered GRC:** Leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance risk analysis and decision-making.

## Role in the GRC Ecosystem: Risk Data Transformer

The Vanguard_Agent serves as the critical link between compliance monitoring and automated enforcement, acting as the primary **Risk Data Transformer** in the GRC ecosystem.

**Data Flow:**
`KSI_Engine (CCE JSON) -> Vanguard_Agent (Enrichment) -> Praetorium_Nexus (Action)`

This flow closes the loop on **FedRAMP 20x Persistent Validation (PVA)** by ensuring that CCE failures (e.g., a NIST CM-6 violation) are treated as actionable vulnerabilities. The agent's core function is to analyze this raw data and prioritize it, ensuring that the most critical issues are addressed first.

By enriching the CCE payload with a refined risk score and an executive summary, the Vanguard_Agent provides the necessary context for the **Praetorium_Nexus** to trigger the correct automated remediation playbook. This directly supports the **Automated Enforcement (KSI-CNA-08)** process, ensuring that security operations are not only continuous but also intelligent.

### Key Features

- **Policy-as-Code with OPA/Rego:** Risk scoring logic is externalized into a Rego policy, allowing for transparent, auditable, and easily adaptable risk management.
- **AI-Enhanced Analysis:** Placeholder logic for AI integration to generate natural language summaries of technical findings for executive review and to refine risk scores with contextual data.
- **Secure Cloud Architecture:** Deployed as a Python Lambda function on AWS using Terraform, ensuring a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution.
- **FedRAMP 20x Alignment:** The agent's primary function is to process and prioritize continuous compliance evidence, a key requirement for FedRAMP 20x Persistent Validation (PVA).
