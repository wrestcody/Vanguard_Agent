# Vanguard_Agent

## Threat-Informed GRC for Mission Assurance

**Vanguard_Agent** is a modular, automated GRC agent designed to transform raw compliance data into actionable, threat-informed intelligence. By integrating policy-as-code (OPA/Rego) and AI-driven analysis, this agent enriches continuous compliance evidence (CCE) to prioritize risks based on organizational policy and real-world threats, not just default severity scores.

This project is a core component of a larger GRC engineering ecosystem, demonstrating a commitment to:
- **Systems Thinking:** Designing modular, interconnected components for a holistic GRC solution.
- **GRC-as-Code:** Automating GRC processes to improve efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
- **AI-Powered GRC:** Leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance risk analysis and decision-making.

### Key Features

- **Policy-as-Code with OPA/Rego:** Risk scoring logic is externalized into a Rego policy, allowing for transparent, auditable, and easily adaptable risk management.
- **AI-Enhanced Analysis:** Placeholder logic for AI integration (e.g., GitHub Spark/Models or Copilot) to generate natural language summaries of technical findings for executive review and to refine risk scores with contextual data.
- **Secure Cloud Architecture:** Deployed as a Python Lambda function on AWS using Terraform, ensuring a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution.
- **FedRAMP 20x Alignment:** The agent's primary function is to process and prioritize continuous compliance evidence, a key requirement for FedRAMP 20x Persistent Validation (PVA).

### Mission Assurance

The ultimate goal of Vanguard_Agent is to enhance mission assurance by:
- **Automating GRC Analysis:** Freeing up engineering and security teams from manual, repetitive tasks to focus on strategic, mission-critical initiatives.
- **Prioritizing Risks:** Focusing remediation efforts on the most critical vulnerabilities, ensuring the security of high-value assets.
- **Improving Communication:** Providing clear, concise, and actionable intelligence to stakeholders at all levels of the organization.
